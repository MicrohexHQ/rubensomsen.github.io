Bitcoin is a world-changing technology that deserves your attention. It allows anyone to send money over the internet without requiring permission or trust.

Seoul Bitcoin is a community that hosts monthly Bitcoin meetups that are accessible to beginners, but also challenges you to understand the technology.

Our meetup is run entirely by volunteers and without a profit motive. This is not a meetup about trading or investing. We care about the technology and hope to convey our excitement.

There are many alternative coins out there that make false claims of superiority. We offer education to help you guard yourself against misinformation.

You can find us on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/seoulbitcoin), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ygnvBkGNTSNcfNjHAt6xQ/videos), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/SeoulBitcoin), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/seoulbitcoinmeetup), and [Kakaotalk](https://goo.gl/v26V7Z). For those who are willing to dive deeper, we also offer weekly in-depth tech meetups.

It is our hope that gaining a deeper understanding of Bitcoin will lead to a deeply motivated community.
