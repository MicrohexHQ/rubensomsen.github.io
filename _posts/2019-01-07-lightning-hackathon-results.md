Considering how well things went, we're already thinking of doing a second event a couple of months down the line. If you'd like to stay informed, keep an eye out on this blog, or [become a member of the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/seoulbitcoin) to receive updates for our monthly events.

Finally, we'd like to thank Blockstream and Samson Mow for the [stickers](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1074326669345714176) and [hats](https://twitter.com/SomsenRuben/status/1075793069734162433)! Everyone was putting the stickers on their devices and wearing the hats, which was awesome to see.
